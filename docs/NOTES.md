# PyPrep — Engineering Notes

A running log of small bootstrap-vs-reality discrepancies and their resolution.
For decisions large enough to merit an ADR, append to `PLAN.md` §6 instead.

## N001 — Coverage gate deferred from 85% to 0% until T2.12

**Phase:** 0 (T0.6) · **Date:** 2026-05-07

The bootstrap `pyproject.toml` shipped with `--cov-fail-under=85` already active.
TODO T0.6 explicitly says "warn-only initially" and T2.12 raises the gate to 85%
once the SDK exists. With no source yet, an 85% gate fails every `pytest` run
and blocks Phase 0 from going green.

**Resolution:** Lowered `--cov-fail-under` to `0` in `pyproject.toml`. T2.12
remains the canonical point at which the project-wide gate is re-raised to 85%
(and `scheduler/` + `stats/` to 95% per Hard Rule 6).

## N002 — FSRS PyPI package is `fsrs`, not `py-fsrs`

**Phase:** 0 (T0.1) · **Date:** 2026-05-07

`PRD.md` §6.2, `PLAN.md` ADR-002, and the bootstrap `pyproject.toml` all
reference `py-fsrs`. That is the **GitHub repo name**
(`open-spaced-repetition/py-fsrs`); the package on PyPI is published as `fsrs`.
`uv sync` failed at first attempt with "py-fsrs was not found in the package
registry".

**Resolution:** Replaced the dependency with `fsrs>=6,<7` (latest published
6.3.1). The library still implements FSRS as described in ADR-002; only the
distribution name changed. PRD/PLAN copy left as-is — the algorithm choice
they document is unchanged.

## N003 — Python pinned to 3.11 via `.python-version`

**Phase:** 0 (T0.1) · **Date:** 2026-05-07

Owner directive: pin to 3.11 (no minor) so `uv` picks the latest 3.11.x
patch consistently across the owner's machine and CI. 3.12 is deferred until
Pyodide and a few transitive libs settle. Documented here so the choice
doesn't drift silently when 3.12 starts looking attractive.
